What Is the Building Control System?


The Building control system is a control system with an integrated virtual test environment in which the control system can be tested without being embedded in the real system. The system hopes to provide comfort and service in an energy efficient way. The system allows full monitoring and control of energy usage and temperature within a given building. The control of these is achieved by the usage of automatic lighting and automatic air conditioning with the possibility of providing optimality by monitoring areas which have low foot fall and restricting the resources in these areas. The integrated virtual test environment allows the impact of new features to be tested. For example the effect of solar panels on energy consumption.



What Is the Building Control System For?


The adaptable building control system controls the parts of the building that can respond to human or environmental stimuli to provide comfort and service in an energy efficient way (e.g. automated lighting; automated air condition). The building control system is created with the objective to reduce the overall impact a building has on the environment. This will be achieved by using resources in a more efficient way. Moreover, the control system aims to reduce the cost of maintaining a building long term as the amount of energy used in maintenance will be reduced. The carbon footprint the building has should be reduced as a result of this control system.



What Problem Does the Building Control System Solve?


The adaptable building control system solves the problem of reducing the large carbon footprint buildings contribute to the environment. In addition, the building control system allows the monitoring and control of energy consumption from one central system.  The virtual test environment component of the system allows new features to be added and the effect of these to be measured in terms of energy consumption. The building control system aims to respond to human stimuli to result in a more energy efficient workplace by using automatic lighting and heating.  



How Does Building Control System Accomplish Its Goals?


The adaptable building control system provides a GUI that allows an easy way of setting up the controller and of monitoring the building (graphical representation of sensor and actuator activities over time (in real time and virtual time)). Also with the use of historical data derived from monitoring the building over time the adaptable building control system will be able to make use of the building's resources in the most efficient way.
